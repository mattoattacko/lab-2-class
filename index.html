        <h1><u>Bio</u></h1>
         <section>
            <p>Howzit brah!? My name is Matt and, as you saw in my game, I was born and raised in Hawaii. I moved to Washington in December of 2015 to pursue a doctorate in physical therapy. Getting into the program of my choice ended up taking longer than I had anticipated, so I decided to pursue other options.</p> 
            <p>I work in outpatient physical therapy in Bellevue, where we see a lot of clients from the big tech companies. The programmers always seemed to enjoy their job, so I spoke with a few of them and was recommended Code Fellows. I'm really enjoying it so far, and hope it leads to an interesting and challenging career.</p>

        <h3><u>Goals</u></h3>
        <section>
            <p>Pipe dream: Due to my background in sports medicine, my interest in human anatomy, and desire to keep on the cutting edge of technology; I would really like to use my coding experience to work in orthopedic medicine via robotics and prosthesis. Realistically: work at a company that's trying to make the world a better place. I guess I'm an idealist.</p>

        <h3><u>Hobbies</u></h3>
        <section>
            <p>Living in Hawaii exposed me to all kinds of cultures and experiences. I've been lucky enough to travel throughout the Pacific, taking in the sites and sounds of each unique location as best I can. My favorite place I've ever been lucky enough to travel is Japan. It's an absolutely incredible country, with a profound and rich cultural heritage. Ranking my favorite places in Japan is difficult, but here's a quick top 10 list.</p>
